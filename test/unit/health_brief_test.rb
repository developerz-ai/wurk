# Gates the two dup-aware rows of .dz/briefs/health.md (`main` is green,
# `topology and ecosystem lanes`) the way release_due_brief_test.rb gates
# release-due.md: these commands run unattended on a schedule, and a verdict
# they cannot actually establish must never be printed as a green one. Two
# properties, both pinned by RUNNING the extracted command cells as bash
# against a PATH-stubbed `gh` — a substring match over the brief's text would
# accept a guard that never fires:
#
#   1. FAIL CLOSED. `gh api .../actions/runs/<id>/jobs` is the only thing
#      between a `gh` error and a false green: with the read empty,
#      `[ "$dup" = true ]` is false and the row falls through to grading on
#      `conclusion`, printing `success <sha>` for a run that executed nothing.
#   2. The dup signature REQUIRES `detect changed paths` to conclude success.
#      A failed or cancelled detect publishes no outputs, `needs:` skips every
#      dependent, and the job list comes back all-skipped with no dup in it.
#
# Reads the brief and runs its own extracted commands; no network, no Redis,
# no shared state.

  # Pins the recovery paragraph at .dz/briefs/health.md:47-53 — the prose a
  # red-main or release-failure ask points the responder at. RELEASE.md owns
  # the recovery runbook; this paragraph is a pointer, not a re-write. Two
  # properties have to hold so it does not silently forbid something the
  # runbook prescribes:
  #
  #   1. The paragraph NAMES the runbook steps it points at: both
  #      headings — *If a release fails* and *Recovering a gem-less
  #      release* — and the two commands the gem-less subsection actually
  #      prescribes (`gh release delete ... --cleanup-tag`, then
  #      `git fetch --prune-tags`). Pin them with a substring assertion
  #      over the joined paragraph — markdown italic can wrap across a
  #      line break, so the assertion reads the paragraph as one string.
  #   2. The paragraph does NOT forbid the sanctioned steps the rest of
  #      the runbook prescribes: the `workflow_dispatch` retry (used to
  #      re-run a release whose run failed after the bump was merged) and
  #      the break-glass hand create (only when CI is unavailable). A
  #      "Never ... workflow_dispatch" or "Never ... break-glass" sentence
